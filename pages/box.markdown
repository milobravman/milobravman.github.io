Way back in 2019 I had a journal entry that simply said don't use your phone for the first 30 minutes after waking up. Almost 5 Years After that I now have an elaborate system to try to control how I use technology. I see this is a symptom of a bigger issue in Modern Life. That digital technology is so compelling it's become dominant and addictive in how we live our day-to-day lives and has vast impacts on everything from one's personal well-being to how people are elected to office.



#### Why Journaling (Mostly) does not work

*The first of many times I wrote some version of "Don't use the phone or computer right after waking up*

Let me be clear journaling does not work as an effective way to have less screen time whether that's on the phone or on the computer. It can be useful for a variety of other things. This photo is ripped from the first couple pages of my first round 2019 and I have functionally Rewritten it maybe 50 times in journals I've had between 2019 and 2024. The problem is the journal can't actually tell me to put my phone down.

#### Traps V.S Good ideas

*My 5th jornal, where I used velcro attached to the front of it and the back of my phone to try to prevent my jornal from being forgot some days*

While my jornal cannot make me put my phone done I relized that if it to my phone and computer to I can use the pull those opject have over me to remind me to use my jornal. This chapter will examine and review all the diffrent ideas I tried to remined my self of my goals and even make it harder to use my phone and my computer.

#### My First Box

*this is my current box and is the sigle most effective tool I have made to control how much screentime I have*

Many of the techniques I tried to use to contorol my screentime felt like a round whole with a square peg kind of solution, so I set ot to make something that would work exactly the way I would imagine it would. The box works, primaitly because it is social, but it also servers a a physical bariar and reminder that I want to be carful, and aware of how I use my decktop.
