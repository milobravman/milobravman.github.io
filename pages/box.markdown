Way back in 2019 I had a journal entry that simply said don’t use your phone for the first 30 minutes after waking up. Almost 5 Years later I now have an elaborate system to try to control how I use technology. I see my need to control my personal use of technology as a symptom of a bigger issue in modern life. Digital technology is so compelling it’s become dominant and addictive in how we live our day-to-day lives and has vast impacts on everything from one’s personal well-being to how people are elected to office.


#### Why Journaling (Mostly) does not work

*The first of many times I wrote some version of “Don’t use the phone or computer right after waking up”*

Let me be clear, journaling does not work as an effective way to have less screen time whether that’s on the phone or on the computer. It can be useful for a variety of other things. This photo is ripped from the first few pages of my first journal, from around 2019. I have functionally rewritten “Don’t use the phone or computer right after waking up” maybe 50 times in journals I’ve had between 2019 and 2022 without it making a lasting difference. The problem is the journal can’t actually tell me to put my phone down.

My journal cannot make me put my phone down, but maybe my phone can make me pick my journal up. Attaching my phone to my journal using velcro attempts to make the phone and the journal one object, where I could not use my phone without using my journal. This, like many of my early attempts to connect a method of controlling my life with a device that has a powerful hold over my life, eventually failed because it took too long to set up, while also being too easy to take apart. The full chapter will go through the many techniques and methods I experimented with and review what worked and what did not.

#### My First Box

*This is my current box, and is the single most effective tool I have made to control how much screen time I have*

Many of the techniques I tried to use to control my screen time felt like a round hole with a square peg kind of solution, so I set out to make something that would work exactly the way I would imagine it would. The box works, primarily because it is social, but it also serves as a physical barrier and reminder that I want to be careful, and aware of how I use my desktop. It also is not very cumbersome to set up. Closing and locking the box takes about 30 seconds maximum, which
