Way back in 2019 I had a journal entry that simply said don't use your phone for the first 30 minutes after waking up. Almost 5 Years After that I now have an elaborate system to try to control how I use technology. I see this is a symptom of a bigger issue in Modern Life. That digital technology is so compelling it's become dominant and addictive in how we live our day-to-day lives and has vast impacts on everything from one's personal well-being to how people are elected to office.

#### The Origin Was Journaling

While in college at Santa Cruz I experienced the infamous sophomore slump, I couldnâ€™t get my work done, I had trouble getting out of bed, ect. I used that christmas break to regroup and I started journaling for the first time in my life. That journal served as a diary primary, but also became the origin of me becoming explicitly aware of how I use digital technology. 

The journals I had from 2019-2022 served as an informal check on my use of digital technology. During which I invented a language that used acronyms such as BAST (before any screen time) to help signify

During this era of journaling I did Flatiron and learned how to code. Coding syntax started to inform how I journaled. Also during this time at home I started to read self help books such as Atomic Habits

#### Going to College (Again)

Eventually I went back to school and joined the ammerman center

I pulled form all these outside sources and started designing physical objects to help me hold to my goals around technology 

I got an internship through this center and developed these chrome extensions, and came up with the schematics, design and built my first computer box.

During the semester I used it in this complex way which overall was a great success

Now where does this project go from here?
