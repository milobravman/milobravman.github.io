Way back in 2019 I had a journal entry that simply said don't use your phone for the first 30 minutes after waking up. Almost 5 Years After that I now have an elaborate system to try to control how I use technology. I see this is a symptom of a bigger issue in Modern Life. That digital technology is so compelling it's become dominant and addictive in how we live our day-to-day lives and has vast impacts on everything from one's personal well-being to how people are elected to office.

*The first of many times I wrote some version of "Don't use the phone or computer right after waking up*

Let me be clear journaling does not work as an effective way to have less screen time whether that's on the phone or on the computer. It can be useful for a variety of other things. This photo is ripped from the first couple pages of my first round 2019 and I have functionally Rewritten it maybe 50 times in journals I've had between 2019 and 2024. The problem is the journal can't actually tell me to put my phone down.
