Lets users block any website that they consider helpful to block. For me this includes websites like Youtube, and chess.com.  See it in the [chrome extention store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/distraction-blocker/gigiekecpijokpijbabheahcnpfchhga?hl=en&authuser=0) or on [github](https://github.com/milobravman/Focus-timer/tree/main/Publishing/Chrome-distraction-blocker).


#### Agency Assistant
Lets users set a timer on a specific page. It will play a success noise if they stay for the time the set, and a failure noise if they leave before then see it in the [chrome extention store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/agency-assistant/pbcoffnbffloddpmembnpojpngdpgcbo?hl=en&authuser=0) or on [github](https://github.com/milobravman/Focus-timer/tree/main/Old/agencyAssistant1.2).
