My name is Milo Lynch and I'm a recent college graduate and computer scientist. My career interest ultimately lies with answering the question is (digital) technology good for us, if not how can it be. This is because over the years I have become more concerned with how I find technology to be addictive and I often ask myself is technology serving me or am I serving technology. So I have started developing strategies, software, and systems to help insure that I'm using technology on my terms.
